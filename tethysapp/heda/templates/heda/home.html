<h1>Hydrological Event Detection & Analysis (HEDA)</h1>
<p>
The Hydrological Event Detection & Analysis (HEDA) tool is a web-client app that enables users to visualize and analyze continuous hydrological and water quality data at the individual storm event scale. The interface allows users to analyze data uploaded by the user or retrieved from the USGS NWIS and CUAHSI HIS databases.</p>
<p>
The HEDA tool is intended for characterization and analysis of the simultaneous water quality and streamflow response during hydrological events. HEDA is most appropriate for use in small to medium sized watersheds where rainfall-runoff processes result in distinguishable events that can be delineated; however, HEDA may also be applicable to other areas such as watersheds with significant snowmelt events.</p>

<h2 >
Features:
</h2>
<p>The HEDA tool has two primary features:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automated detection and delineation of hydrological events from continuous time series of streamflow.</li>
	<li>Event visualization and analysis including calculation ofevent metrics and hysteresis analysis.</li></ol>
<p>
The detection and delineation of events can be performed over a year of records at a given time. The visualization and analysis of events includes the description of both streamflow and water quality metrics.
</p>
<p>HEDA includes the option to download as .csv files both event delineations as well as event metrics.</p>

<h3>
Data Sources:
</h3>
<p>    
To use HEDA on user uploaded files, the data must be formatted as a .csv. It is optional to have events already delineated. An example file is provided:

HEDA was developed as part of a CUAHSI Hydroinformatics Innovation Fellowship project by Dr. Scott Hamshaw and Ali Javed at the University of Vermont.</p>
<p>
The event detection and delineation algorithm implemented was adapted from the method developed by Weigang Tang and Sean Carey at McMaster University and is also available as a MATLAB toolbox.
